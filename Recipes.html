            <h3>Ingredients: 2 tbsp. lard or unsalted butter
                2 tbsp. neutral oil
                2 poblano chiles, seeded and finely chopped
                1 medium white onion, finely chopped
                4 cloves garlic, chopped
                Kosher salt
                3 (4-oz.) cans diced green chiles
                2 c. low-sodium chicken stock
                1 c. packed cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus more leaves for serving
                12 (6") corn tortillas
                4 c. shredded rotisserie chicken, divided
                1 (15-oz.) can black beans, drained, divided
                1 c. (6 oz.) shredded Monterey Jack or mozzarella cheese, divided
                Sour cream, sliced avocado, and sliced radish, for serving</h3>
            <p>
                Step 1
Preheat oven to 350°. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat lard and oil. Add poblano chiles, onion, garlic, and 2 teaspoons salt. Cook, stirring often, until vegetables are softened and beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. 
Step 2
Add green chiles and stock, scraping up bits from bottom of skillet. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce has slightly reduced, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer mixture to a blender; reserve skillet. Add cilantro to blender and blend until smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. 
Step 3
Place a tortilla directly on gas burner over high heat. Toast, turning once, until edges are slightly charred, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a cutting board and repeat with remaining tortillas, stacking them on top of each other. Cut tortilla stack in half.
Step 4
Pour one-third of sauce into bottom of reserved skillet. Top with half of tortillas in an even layer, followed by 2 cups chicken, 3/4 cup beans, and 3/4 cup cheese. Pour in another one-third of sauce. Top with layers of remaining tortillas, 2 cups chicken, and 3/4 cup beans. Pour over remaining one-third sauce and top with remaining cheese.
Step 5
Bake enchiladas until warmed through and cheese is melted, 18 to 22 minutes. 
Step 6
Dollop with sour cream. Top with cilantro, avocado, and radish. </p>

            <h3>Ingredients:
                1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
                1/2 yellow onion, chopped
                2 cloves garlic, minced
                1 tsp. dried oregano
                1 tsp. smoked paprika
                1 c. white rice
                Kosher salt
                Freshly ground black pepper
                1 1/4 c. low-sodium chicken broth or water
                2 medium carrots, diced
                1 red bell pepper, chopped
                3 boneless skinless chicken breasts
                Freshly chopped parsley, for garnish</h3>
            <p>Step 1
                Preheat Instant Pot by setting to “Sauté”. Add oil and cook onion until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, and paprika and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. 
                Step 2
                Stir in rice and broth and season with salt and pepper. Add carrots, bell pepper, and chicken, and season generously again with salt and pepper.  
                Step 3
                Close lid, change setting to manual or "Pressure Cook" and set for 8 minutes on High. When 8 minutes is up, let pot decompress naturally for 10 minutes, then release pressure, remove lid, and shred chicken. Top with parsley before serving.</p>
